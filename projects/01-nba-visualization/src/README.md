# Source Code

This folder contains the R Markdown file used as the main code workspace for the NBA three-point project.

Per course requirements, all code lives in a single `.Rmd` file as chunked scripts for:
- importing and cleaning data from `data/`
- computing derived metrics (including season-normalized measures)
- generating the plots and tables used in the final write-up

Note: this file is not intended to be knitted into the final blog post. It’s a consolidated record of the analysis code and visualization steps.
