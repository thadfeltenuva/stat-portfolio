This folder contains the datasets used in the NBA three-point analysis project. The data spans team-level and player-level statistics across multiple seasons.

## Datasets

**Team Summaries.csv**  
Season-level team statistics, including wins, losses, offensive metrics, and three-point attempt data. This file serves as the primary dataset for league-wide and team-level trend analysis.

**Team Stats Per Game.csv**  
Per-game team statistics by season, including pace, scoring, and shooting breakdowns. Used to analyze changes in offensive structure over time.

**Advanced.csv**  
Advanced team metrics such as offensive rating, defensive rating, and efficiency-based statistics. Used to evaluate whether offensive growth can be explained by traditional efficiency measures.

**NBA_Champion_Data.csv**  
Season-level data identifying championship teams. Used to compare champions against league averages in the same season.

**Player Totals.csv**  
Player-level seasonal totals, including usage and shooting statistics. Used to examine role evolution and position-level adaptation in response to the rise of three-point offense.
